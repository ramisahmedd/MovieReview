Inception
Review: The movie is based on stealing the confidential ideas of a person by going into their dream. In the beginning, the movie looks boring but when Leonardo DiCaprio starts making the team for the big plan. It's a great insert movie to watch which have dreams on top of dreams inside dreams.The movie is based on stealing the confidential ideas of a person by going into their dream.
